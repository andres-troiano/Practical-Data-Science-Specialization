-1,When i saw this blouse online i thought it looked like a great combination of casual with the elegance of an intricate print. i was so disappointed when it came. the print is not centered in the front or the back. it looks like they were trying to save on the material and just cut it out wherever with no thought to symmetry. for this price the detail of centering the design was expected  especially because this is how it appeared in the picture. loved the blouse  but i will be returning it becau,Blouses
-1,This blouse is a disappointment . fabric is cheap looking and the cut is very off. just odd. sleeves awkward . the back of the white shirt on the on-line model is not the same as the white shirt i received. mine was plain in the back like the blue shirt on line even though my shirt was white. no ruffle. returned.,Blouses
-1,I loved this shirt and attempted to buy it - however the armhole is so small i couldn't barely get the shirt off and almost had to call someone into the dressing room to pull it off of me. i'm usually a 6 and i tried on the 6 and 8  and both shirts had the same problem. it wasn't exactly the sleeve that was too tight  but the arm hole that was not big enough. it pulled across the top of my chest and was not roomy enough to slip in and out of. which was odd because the rest of shirt was fine. i d,Blouses
-1,Material is so thin this shirt ripped in three places after wearing only once.    got a size larger than i needed as i have a larger chest and even though it's a bit lose the thread has ripped material on my chest and in the armpits.,Blouses
-1,This would be a great blouse for flat chested person. i am a size 12 and busty. i ordered an xl and it was ridiculously tight across the chest and the fabric is see through. you would need to wear a cami under it.,Blouses
-1,"This top did nothing for me. it billowed in the front and was not flattering. for reference  i am 5""4  115 pounds  and small chested. i ordered the smallest size the top came in (cannot recall if it was an xs or 0). i promptly returned it.",Blouses
-1,"I so wanted to love this tank  and was so excited to get it in the mail! i got a size small (my usual) and it ran so large i wasn't even sure an xs would've fit properly. the material looked lighter and blouse-y on the model  but in person is much thicker and sort of ""hangs"". underarms run large and are gaping from the body. i am sad to return this top because i love the color and idea of it  but it just can't work on me!",Blouses
-1,This tunic could be great but there is some weird construction going on at the armhole. first of all  the armhole is way too low! second  there is a totally unnecessary side seam zipper under the arm. since this is a tunic it slips over the head no problem. no need for the side zipper  it adds bulk and distorts the way the fabric should hang at the side.,Blouses
-1,I loved the design and look to this shirt  but it ran way big for me. i loved the forgiving fit  but it just wasn't flattering at all. i even went down one size and it still was huge. sad to send this one back.,Blouses
0,This blouse is super cute but oddly sized. i bought a size up and still i squeezed into the top around the bust. the front slit is too low and shows a bit too much cleavage  so this had to go back. i really tried because the fabric is wonderful and the shirt is light and breezy for summer  i just couldn't make it work  .,Blouses
0,After the reviews about sizing  i ordered the size 16 (am normally size large). interestingly  the tag on the blouse says it's a 14. with all that said  the blouse is cute enough and sizing up gave me enough length (in spite of the higher sides) that i'm considering keeping it. although it's a bit big  it flows nicely and isn't oversized in that wide  crazy way. the sleeves are a bit too big but they're cuffed with a button and can be rolled. the fabric is somewhat crinkled in texture. i got the,Blouses
0,"I really wanted to like this top  but couldn't seem to find the right fit. i tried it on in 3 different sizes and none of them were right - they were either too wide in the hips  or a little narrow in the shoulder. it is cute overall though - and a good way to do a short top  without feeling like you're in a ""crop top""",Blouses
0,This was my favorite item in the august catalog & i knew i had to have it. my store had not received it yet so i ordered online. after reading the other reviews  i sized down and the fit is still much too large as this top has way too much material. this is coming from someone who loves swing tees and can appreciate a loose fit. however  this top hangs like a tent. also  the elastic around the bottom of the sleeves is quite uncomfortable. i do think the top is pretty and recommend only if you ar,Blouses
0,Gorgeous but just too short in length for anyone with a long torso.  i sized up to get more length  but then the neck opening was way too big and hung open to expose - well  everything up top.  wearing a cami would be an option but would take away from the dressiness of the top.  i had to leave without this item  but was disappointed because i love the colors and cut otherwise!,Blouses
0,This shirt is absolutely beautiful. however  it runs very small. proportion-wise it's okay in the shoulders  bust  and back but it's too short! definitely order up!,Blouses
0,I saw this top online and had to buy it immediate (which is rare for me). it looked loose and forgiving but had a polished look. it didn't disappoint when i tried it on. however  the straps are a bit loose and will need to be altered. the linen fabric can be rough or itchy  but still a gorgeous top!,Blouses
0,Super large and a very weird cut.  the sides were much shorter than the front and back and this just looked awful on me.,Blouses
0,"I loved this top in the blue and wanted so badly for it to fit however it was very unflattering on my 5'7"" frame. the bottom hemline is straight across all around whereas i thought it was longer in the back. i could see this looking great on a really petite frame. runs large  xs fit however wasn't flattering",Blouses
1,This is a very flattering top and the details are spectacular. it is very comfortable to wear and the the appliquã©s and embroidery make this very slimming. as the other reviews noted the side slits go up quite high. i won't be raising my arms much wearing this. the small rhinestones in the center of the black flowers go around the entire sleeve and they catch on the rest of the shirt sometimes. i have to be aware of it and more careful not to make very fast movements until i'm sure i'm not tangl,Blouses
1,"I'm 5'7"" with a 36 b bra size and a size 4 fit perfectly and could not have been more comfortable. one big plus for me is that it is virtually wrinkle free. i purchased the orange which is a lovely muted orange  not neon or too bright and received multiple compliments when i wore it to work the first time.",Blouses
1,I have to disagree with earlier reviewers who suggested this top isn't flattering for larger-breasted women. i'm breastfeeding  so i currently have dds that are the bane of my existence  and i was very happy with the way this top fit across my chest. i didn't give it a full 5 stars for aesthetic/design only because i wish it were a bit longer. it hit me below my waist  but not below the crotch of my jeans where it hits the model (possibly because she is not burdened by swollen breasts). the shir,Blouses
1,I am on the fence with this one.......the black lace on the bottom is beautiful and pairs so well with my black velvet gladiator sandals..... but it came very wrinkled  and the fabric almost feels more like a cheap cotton. i am always in between a sm and med  so tried the small. the shoulders do want to slide up a bit. arms need to be down.  it is very voluminous......and falls below my bottom. would make a pretty maternity top!! the idea of it overall is pretty  but not sure i want all the volu,Blouses
1,I love this top  on me  it looks so flattering  the tie detail is really nice  and i love the white subtle details at the bottom and collar. i actually haven't seen the sleeves unrolled on me  i roll them up. the tie part is a little wrinkled from shipment  but who cares. i ordered the regular 0 as the petite have been sold out a longtime ago  i actually got this shirt a while back and thought i had already written a review... i am wearing it with boyfriend jeans right now (for casual friday and,Blouses
1,I got this shirt in black  and it's perfect for the office. i ordered a medium  which i thought was a little on the larger side. well made  the details make it an interesting top.,Blouses
1,I bought this shirt in a size 10. i am a 32 4d and it fit perfect  but wanted it to fit flowy as it does on the model...so sizing up to a 12. very nice quality fabric...not sure how it will be after it's washed. looks just like the picture. i bought the ivory color.,Blouses
1,I thought this shirt was really feminine and elegant. only downsides is some of the punched out holes had fabric still attached which you have cut off with scissors- otherwise the shirt will snag. and the second issue of bigger importance are the low armholes. lots of bra showing- not really sure how to get around that so i always wear it with a cardigan. but it would be nice not to have to.   other than that it looks nice and pairs nicely with almost anything.,Blouses
1,This top is a lovely combination of rugged and refined and will be versatile wear for a party pared with nice pants and flats to casual with jeans and boots. it appears well made though i had to size up for my broad shoulders but other hh tops fit the same way.,Blouses

-1,I really loved this dress in the store when i tried it on the color and fabric were perfect for summer but once i got this home i noticed the placket wouldn't lay flat across the bust like shown in pictures. when i went up a size it was too large under the arms so this one will sadly have to go back to the store.,Dresses

-1,This dress runs very large. i am 5'4 and 120 lbs  hourglass  curvy build. i ordered a size small and its enormous on me. the description says fitted but it is not fitted at all. it's like a big wool sack. i'd have to gain 30 lbs for this dress to come close to fitting. i'm very sad that the fit is so far off and the dress is now all sold out in all smaller sizes  including petite.

-1,I really wanted to like this dress. the color is perfect  the design and cut are cut (not always the case at retailer). however  the fabric quality was terrible - a shiny acrylic with cheap nylon lace. it looked like something from a discount store and had to go back.,Dresses
-1,Generally  i find sizing at retailer to be very consistent  so i ordered this dress in the same size that i order all of my other retailer dresses. the bust was way to small. so i had to go and return this and have the next size up shipped to me. it's till way too small! in addition  the shipping was terrible - the dress was just dumped into a bag with no attempt to fold this  and the right strap was defective! it's so irritating that i have to return this again!,Dresses

0,"As previously mentioned  this dress runs very large. i ordered accordingly  and the small was the right size for my frame  but it was just not flattering. i'm pear shaped  and i found the shoulders to be large  the neck a bit too high  and the overall cut to hug my figure in a very unflattering way. i'm 5'4""  140-ish  and maybe if i were a few pounds lighter and a few inches taller  it could've worked. i so wanted to love this  because it's soft and comfortable and cute  but back it goes.",Dresses
0,"I had really high hopes for this dress  and i am still unsure if i'll keep it or not. i ordered both a small and a medium because i was unsure of this brand. the small fit (i""m usually a 4 s/m at retailer - 34b  140 lb  5'8"") just like it does on the model  only the photo online gives the illusion that this is a slight fit-and-flare dress. this is a shift with pleating subtleties on the bustline that bring it in slightly. also  the colors should be more like ""blue multi"" because there's a bright a",Dresses
0,"This is a beautiful dress with unfortunate design flaws at the bodice of the dress. the fit at hips and length is perfect  falling just to my knee (i'm 5'5"" 142 lbs.) and grazing my hips. in that regard the fit is spectacular. but the bodice seems cut very oddly  which would require tayloring to correct. the armholes are large and flared at the bottom which leaves 'wings' just under the arms that stick out. since this dress has a side zip  to correct that would seem a major undertaking. the stra",Dresses
0,I wanted to love this dress. i went into retailer in sb to try it on and when i saw it on the rack it looked beautiful  both the print and the material. then i tried it on and it fit like a tent. i am just under 5'5 and it hit right below my knees  not like shown in the picture here. on that note  i passed on this one due to the fit. i think this would make a fantastic maternity dress though.,Dresses
0,I wanted to love this dress so much but it just looked frumpy no matter what i did. i'm normally a 14  and i bought a size 12 and it still looks very baggy and not flattering. i'm sad because in photos it's my favorite dress of all time!,Dresses

1,The first reviewer said it was small in the bust  but the 0p i ordered fit everywhere  rib cage and all  but was gaping at the bust (in the back). i would say overall it was true to size but if i sized down  it would be too snug in the rib cage. i am 30dd for reference there and waist is 26.5 inches     otherwise  the make is very pretty  i like the texture in the fabric  the color is very pretty as well. embroidery seemed high quality  but i decided to pass on it  even on sale  since it didn't,Dresses
1,I spend a lot of time on the retailer website. it never occurred to me to try this dress. a salesperson suggested it in the store and i tried it on. it is really cute on. i bought a thrift store denim jacket to throw over it. the only con is the sleeves. i am 5'3' and my arms are not very long. the bell sleeves are a little crazy on me  but they will be hidden under the jacket.,Dresses
1,I am a fan of these designers and their gorgeous fabrics - most of which are heavy brocades. this is so pretty and fun. the print is playful  and colors are gorgeous  and the fit is floaty but not too full or too tight. i love the bit of beading  and that i can dress it up or down.    i am petite and not usually a bigger print or long dress fan  but i know that i will wear this one for years.     i did get a 00 petite as i know that only this small size fits me at retailer - 0's swallow me. this i,Dresses
1,I bought this dress in-store  and it's fantastic. i'm between a medium and a large  and i bought a large because it was the one available  and it's fantastic. some of the polyester is fraying between the seams  which is obviously not ideal  but i'm willing to overlook that for generally how great this dress is.,Dresses

1,This is a dress for a princess. i admire this dress so much  online and in person. i tried on this dress a few times every time i visited the store. the beads throughout the dress provide a low-key surprise sparkle  especially in the sun. the colors are much more vibrant in person  which is breathtaking against the light cream background. the fabric is soft and flowy. unfortunately for me  it doesn't fit right. size 6 fits well but the arm holes are too big and the midi part makes me look frumpy,Dresses

-1,It hangs very nicely on the model in the picture but when i put it on it fit tight in the sleeves and upper back but huge in the front. the sweater was also sparkly which made it look cheap. i loved the lace detail in the back but the sweater was returned. did not fit well and was not good quality. very thin,Fine gauge
-1,I also expected this sweater to have more bulk to it per the images. it is very thin as others have said. the design is awkward with the sleeve placement and that makes it more flowy vs. structured. it is more similar to a cape or shawl design. if you;'re looking for a warm cozy blanket sweater design  this is not it. i will keep it though as a layering piece and because of the sale price and classic color design.,Fine gauge

0,This is a relatively cute top when you try it on. however  i don't think it will hold it's shape after even just 1 wear. it also doesn't seem like you could wash it without ruining it (like a shirt form a 'throw-away' cheap clothing store). i checked the fabric tag and it is a very high % viscose - meaning  it won't last long at all. i'm returning and feel frustrated with how cheap the fabric is.,Fine gauge
0,I really liked the fabric and the design of this sweater  but the sleeves hung at an odd length (no way to push them up like on the model) and the sweater was large on me. i have broad shoulders but am otherwise petite. unfortunately i had to return this. glad others are having better luck.,Fine gauge
0,I bought three of these this summer--a mint  ivory  and yellow. when i received them  they looked nice enough in person. i liked the heart motif and the peplum. the problem is the knit was on the cheap side and stretched out. the arms were tighter than i liked but loosened up through the day. but  then the look became more matronly. i wish they had been 3/4 length or a vest. the cheap  outstretched look just didn't work. i ended up donating all of mine after a few wears. they also pilled conside,Fine gauge

0,I love cashmere  love the length  cowl-neck and colors  however i found the yellow to be bit more vibrant in person  which i liked. i'm not sure i will keep this because it seemed to be a bit too thin for my taste. i would gladly pay a bit more for a thicker ply sweater... i might justify this one at a sale price.,Fine gauge

0,I have a mixed feeling about this cardigan.  on one hand  i like it; on the other hand  there are some minor things i do not like.  first  i love its knit pattern; especially the pattern on the back.  second  i like a soft color of this cardigan.  on website pictures  two motifs look almost the same.  in reality  brown motif is light pink-ish while blue motif is light blue-green-ish.  third  texture.  this cardigan is made of linen and cotton  so it feels comfortable to wear.  if there are flaws,Fine gauge
0,First  i love moth clothing and own many  many of their pieces. this is very cute and i purchased it to go with the jules tank. the other reviewers are spot on with the cute factor and that it runs a little larger than the cropped sweaters. the snails are very cute  buttons run all the way down... caveat: it began to pill after only a having it on a few hours - and i wasn't doing anything to cause extra friction- just sitting and lounging mostly. i noticed pilling on the inside of the arms when,Fine gauge

0,I'm a 32-a  and i bought a small. i found that the tube portion is pretty tight  but probably needed to keep things up. because there is not a clasp in the front or back  it is really hard to get in and out of. i'd probably be ok with it  but the cups were too big for me. i think i would need to be a c to fill it.  the quality is really nice and the molded cups are a good shape. i wish i could have made it work  because it was really comfortable. i returned it in the end.,Intimates
0,I have been eyeing this piece for months now! i broke down and bought it when they finally had my size in stock. i am 5 '4 and 110 lbs and have a very small chest so i ordered an xs. i think the top is too baggy for me. yes  the top and bottoms fit overall  but it doesn't look as nice and form fitting like it does on the model. it is very sheer--which is the thing that discourages me the most. i love the concept of this piece but the execution could use some work  which i am willing to work on s,Intimates
0,I wanted to love these because they are so pretty and come in lots of colors  but after only a few minutes of wearing them  i was having to pull them out of my bottom! why does women's underwear so frequently ride up? i normally wear a size 4/28  and ordered these in a m  but i guess they were still too small  which seems unreasonable to me. they are soft and pretty  but i will not be ordering more.,Intimates
0,If your hips are bigger than a size 6 us you can't fully close this robe. the model must be wearing the larger of the two sizes to have such a nice oversized fit. the fabric is soft and lux and amazing  but the weird dart in the back and the closure is right over my sadly size 8 hips and butt. if i was taller and thinner i would have kept this and worn it every day.,Intimates
0,"The fit is gorgeous  but i didn't realize it was completely transparent. when it says ""mesh"" it means ""mesh""! i was thinking the ""mesh"" part was on the bottom. because of how it is cut  high on the shoulders  you can't wear a cami underneath to provide coverage. very cute  but not practical.",Intimates
0,I really was looking forward to this piece but unfortunately it was too small to even pass through my head nevertheless i couldn't even get both arms in. i got a size small and probably needed a large; but as far as the quality and color  it's really pretty! just go up a size or two if anything and try it out.,Intimates
0,This is pretty and provides coverage with a bit of support for wearing around the house. i'm a 34b so i ordered the small- it still had room in it so i tightened the straps and used the tightest hooks on the back  and that makes it fit ok. i bought it just to wear at home since i was not expecting a great deal of support or shaping  and while it feels ok it is not super-comfy- it's a bit scratchy around the edges. i was going to buy another color if i loved this  but as it is i will keep the one,Intimates
1,Good design  comfortable fit. however  sizing is way off. i am a 34c and the small fits with minimal support. agree with the previous review. not sure it is a keeper.,Intimates

1,This bra is so soft and comfortable i feel like i'm not wearing a bra at all  except i have the gentle support i need. the material is very thin and the pink color is see through  so not recommended under a white or see through shirt. perfect for sleeping or lounging in!,Intimates

1,I love this gown so much  i would wear it everyday if i could. it is cozy  beautiful  and feels special like an heirloom. the top is perfect coverage and the skirt is so soft. color is much prettier than the photo picks up!!! i love this gown. my favorite  hands down.,Intimates
-1,I ordered this to wear for a holiday party hoping to have something unique and dressy. it was too bulky at the shoulders and looked like something a football player would wear. the little ruffled flower pieces were random at the top and stuck out in all the wrong directions. it wasn't as elegant as the model pic (is it ever?) and for this price should fit like a glove. went back within seconds. also  it's pretty short  and bulky short isn't flattering on too many people.,Jackets
-1,I was hesitant to buy this because it is double breasted which isn't my first choice. that was the least of the problems with this jacket. i love sparkle  and i love beautiful detail  none of the elements by themselves was a problem. the sum of the parts didn't work  though. the end result was an unflattering  confusing mess. the silhouette plus the frayed edges  plus the sequins plus the vent in back plus the huge buttons plus the double breast  plus the zipper were just too many things to go t,Jackets
-1,This jacket is just too small for me anyway and i am no way big. i am tall and athletic and this thing looked like it had shrunk in the wash. there are so many better fitting other types out there  this went back,Jackets
-1,I wish this fit me better. i love the inside fur. it is extremely soft but it doesn't look flattering at all. it makes my shoulders look really broad and it was shorter in the length than i wanted. it wanted it fit over my butt (or cover half) and it sits a little below my waist. unfortunately i am taking it back. great idea though.,Jackets
-1,1. i like a shorter jacket  but this one was poorly made and poorly fit.  2. the sleeves were way too tight. i'm a size 10 or 12  and the large which would be a 14 had tight sleeves that wrinkled up my arms  and the hem of the sleeve turned inside out.  3. i ordered both a medium (size 10) and a large (size 14)   and neither hung right. the m too tight  and the large too loose in the body and too tight in the sleeves.  4. very polyester with lots of static.  5. cute idea  but not very good in pe,Jackets
-1,Love retailer's kimonos and when i saw this pattern i had to have it! unfortunately  when i bought it the tag was already showing holes so they gave me 15% off... went to wear it for the first time  there was already a huge snag in it! i love retailer but for 98$ this is not worth your money.,Jackets
-1,I purchased this jacket in my local store. size 10 and runs really small . i love the color combination and design but the fabric in my opinion is poor quality. i have seen a lot of retailer use this poly spun knit in so much of their items and the jacket after bringing it home and looking in the light was already showing pilling. looks like it is worn in an bad way. returned the next day. this was a big disappointment and every time i see this fabric being used in retailer clothes it makes me mad.,Jackets
-1,Does not look like the picture. lined with a cheap denim fabric inside that shows when arms are rolled up. i normally always fit in mediums and this jacket is so small in the arms as well as body that it fit like a xs.,Jackets
-1,I have never had a purchase go wrong at retailer  which is why i am was not hesitant to spend this much money on the blazer. however  the quality is very poor - it feels like it might fall apart after one clean. also  the buttons where not sewn on properly. i wear an xs and the size was a good fit  but the overall quality was not worth the price (or even close to it).,Jackets

0,The blazer is boxy and less dressy that it seemed online. i could only really wear this in casual situations  and i was hoping to be able to wear it to work as well. it does have an interesting hemline. the shoulders are a bit too narrow for me (but i do have shoulders on the broader side). i don't hate it  but i don't love it either  but it is interesting enough that i'm going to keep it. i ordered a small.,Jackets

0,I live in ny and bought his coat for the winter  thinking since it was made out of wool it would be warm. this coat is extremely thing  more like a spring/fall coat and therefore i don't think the price justifies the quality. i am going to return and consider repurchasing if it goes on sale. i also wish it had a button or way of keeping it closed rather than just hang loosely.,Jackets
0,I wanted to love this jacket. so soft and great color. unfortunately it is just too light weight. it is almost like shirt fabric. nice heft to the fabric though. nice length - accept the sleeves were short on me. i am 5'10 and 135lbs. the small was the right size. i was looking for something slightly warmer to layer.,Jackets
0,The material is so soft and cozy. there is just enough padding to keep me warm all year round in southern california. but  i ended up leaving the store without this vest  bc 1)the cut is slightly boxy.  2) every vest had different color variations. you definitely should go into the store to check it out. the ones i saw made the vest have cheap pattern of wide stripes  not an even vintage fade as shown. i'm so sad as everything else is perfect. fits true to size,Jackets
0,Ordered my regular size large and the fit was a snug around my hips when snapped. i didn't plan on wearing it that way so that wasn't a deal breaker for me. but because i have a larger bust i felt the padding added pounds and lots of width to my frame. i also had the same issues with coloring as other reviewers. and lastly  the collar is really high and it just bugged me. so this one went back.,Jackets
1,Perfect for summer nights. makes any outfit that much special!,Jackets
1,I love this vest! there are so many ways to style it...open or tied closed  over a dress or with a tshirt and jeans. i get compliments every time i wear it. it's soft and light enough to add interest to an outfit without being too heavy/hot to wear all day.,Jackets
1,"I have the marrakech vest from the summer and really liked the quality and fit of that  so i ordered this one. fit is very similar. this one is made of a lightweight cotton  and has a similar cut. will be a great fall transitional jacket  and looks great with lots of things--maxi skirts  skinny jeans  long tops with the hems peaking out  etc. i found it tts: i got an xs and am 5'4""  120 lbs. i don't plan to wear more than a thin top underneath  but don't think i could fit a sweater under the sle",Jackets

1,This is a well-made kimono style jacket  in a great color choice that is versatile and well constructed. being short and with narrow shoulders  most kimono-style jackets don't work on me; they are simply too big & too long. this jacket's shorter length and more streamlined styling make it perfect for me. a keeper  and a real steal on sale.,Jackets
1,This is a must have for summer. i'm always hot but sometimes a sweater just doesn't look right. the short sleeves are just what i've been looking for. every jacket i own runs smaller on me around the bust and arms  so i think for everyone else  your normal jacket size should be perfect.,Jackets
1,I recently purchased this vest and unlike other reviews  i found it to be tts. with that being said  i am typically a medium in retailer tops or 8/10. i have broad shoulders (5'9  145lbs). i purchased the medium and it fit perfect through the shoulders. it is meant to be flowy and gives some volume in a good way. if that's the look you are going for this is the top for you. had i gone down a size  i would not have been able to hook the top. i am going to be wearing this with blue jeans and white s,Jackets

1,Love the swing-style boxy fit. versatile - works well over jeans or any pants and top. like the coated linen (or cotton?) look. serves much the same purpose as any light weight or denim jacket - good to wear over a top to complete an outfit or as an extra thin layer but not a substantial outdoor jacket. really quite cute. fairly tts but if between sizes  size down.,Jackets

-1,"Woah  these jeans looked ridiculous on me. i felt as though it was 1987 and i was raiding my mom's closet. the combination of the light wash  the crop leg and high waist with the odd stitching around the midsection make this a no. it really accentuates any pouch you may have. i was looking for a high waisted denim but these are very unflattering. i am 5'3"" / 140 curvy. no  no  no!",Jeans

0,I absolutely love the look and fit of these jeans. i did have to size down. i ran into problems after washing. the fraying on one leg was twice that of the other  looking very unbalanced. after looking closely i found that one leg had a top stitching very close to the fray to prevent further fraying. the other leg did not have this stitching  thus the fraying double in size. i have sent a request to customer service for a replacement pair. these are adorable jeans just be sure to check for stitc,Jeans
0,I have been searching for grey jeans and haven?t found anything that i truly love. i tried on both a 25p and 26p. the 25p was too tight and i don?t think they would have stretched out enough for me to be comfortable in. the 26p was close but i was afraid they would stretch out too much. they looked good from the front but did nothing for my cushion. the color  length and feel of the jeans was perfect. in the end they went back and the hunt continues for grey jeans. i would recommend trying these,Jeans

0,I agree with the other reviews that these jeans run big. for my body  straight up and down  i ordered 2 sizes down  but would have ordered one size down had i been able to try them on in the store. the jeans i received were lighter  not blue  and more grey with very noticeable white whiskering. i need a new pair of jearns and i love the cut of these so i am keeping this pair  but  for me  because of the color they are just ok compared to the wow i was expecting from the picture.,Jeans

-1,Wow! this sure is close fitting  as in suction cups to your body! yikes  definitely not forgiving for those of us with curves. to me  it seems like the material will wear well. i bought this for a great sales price so i may keep it  not sure. it would work fine as a layering piece but if i gain even 5 lbs  it won't work. i ordered the medium and am usually a small. the large might have worked best but probably still pretty clingy. i do recommend this if you are thin with no problem areas.,Layering
0,I love the wide straps but it runs small and is short. still great for layering. great  soft material. i hate that it is so tight and short but if i size up them the arm holes would be way too big.,Layering
0,I nearly always wear a size small  and sometimes even a small is too large. not in this case; this top is extremely snug. i would not be able to wear this  and i would've returned for a larger size but the ivory color was a little too yellow for me. in the online photo. the color is more of an off-white than ivory yellow. i'm guessing also that this fabric may not stand the test of time and easily snag. but that's just conjecture.,Layering
0,"I like this shirt  as in general i prefer more form-fitting and less flowy shirts. however  after washing the shirt and hanging dry it has shrunk to be too short to wear with even mid-rise jeans. so: good if you don't like long t-shirts  bad if you are tall  like me (5'8"") and don't want to wear a crop top.",Layering
0,I was looking for an undergarment and this is more of a nightgown. if it came in a solid color then i'd probably buy it. i usually wear a small and this was a tad too tight. on the upside  the fabric was soft and lightweight.,Layering
0,I love the way the mock neck style looks  but the shirt is cut very small. i realize it's supposed to stretch  but it's still very  very tight on  particularly in the shoulder area. if you like the style  i'd recommend sizing up.,Layering
0,I loved this when i got it. it has such a flattering fit! slightly loose in the body  but not flowy. nice weight of fabric. comfortable fabric. perfect scoop neck that doesn't show too much cleavage. but i washed it once on delicate and line dried (which i do with most of my shirts) and it came out riddled in holes.,Layering
0,"This spandex top  in my opinion  is workout wear. it is not the tank i expected to receive  but my bad. it is super stretchy tank like most folks use with leggings or workout shorts. it does seem small but perhaps due to the kind of tank it is  it should fit like this. 5' 5"" 142 lbs medium is skin tight. color is nice but  as i wanted a tank to wear with skirts or jeans and this is not what i had envisioned-it has to go back to retailer. quality seems fair.",Layering
0,This seemed to run a little bit small on me... more form fitting than on the model in the photo. also  it's thin. i'd be sold on it for sure if it were just a little longer too because i like the almost-lingerie-like look. the lace applique is pretty  and if you purchase it for that  then it really shows up better on the two lighter colors - it really gets lost all in black.,Layering

1,This turtleneck is already wrapped and it's soon going under the tree for me! i bought it when i saw it in the store and tried it on. it's fitted but not too tight or snug... just fitted and flattering. the lace cutout area is so flattering and unexpected. i love this top and think it will be a wardrobe staple - both for dress and casual.

-1,Adorable foxes  i was smitten in the store but the fix is bizarre and the foxes don't come up very high so you're limited in the length you can wear. i bought the m/l based on salesperson advice and i can't imagine trying anything smaller  i usually wear a size s or 4 bottom  these were super snug. back to the store they went.,Legwear

-1,I am floored by all of the positive comments about these culottes! i can see that they would work for someone who is rail thin and has no hips... but for those of us with curves (i'm a size 12  hourglass)  these are very unflattering. they made me look like i was carrying an extra 20-30 pounds  just around the hips! so bummed because they look so cute on the model.,Pants
-1,I bought these in the mustard color and the salmon color.  i didn't have a problem with general fading  but used natural  mild stain remover (biokleen) and the pants were ruined. one faded where i sprayed and the other has a permanent water mark.  cold wash and line dried. such a bummer that these pants aren't every day wearable and washable!,Pants
-1,I was so excited to try these but was really disappointed in the fit. i found the legs and butt to be tight but the waist to be really big. if you are normally a size 24  i wouldn't bother with these.,Pants
-1,Given that i am petite with thighs (take a size 6p or 28p) these were not for me! the run small  are really tight from the thigh up  run longer that a petite should and are fairly thin. on top of that the zipper and hook in the back are really inconvenient. i was looking for something i could wear to work  and these were not the right style for that. plus they seemed cheaply made  like they wouldn't stand the test of time. i imagine if you are tall and skinny like the model  they would look good,Pants
-1,They look nice on the page  but they didn't work on my body. made me look big and boxy. maybe if you're super-skinny  they'll be fine.,Pants
-1,Loved these in store when i tried them on but was in between sizes so i ordered them in the larger size. boy do i regret that! these stretch out so much i have to wear a belt with them and it gives me this saggy bunchy front when i sit...not attractive. wish i could return them  but i took the tag off and wore them not knowing this before hand!! if in between sizes definitely size down.,Pants
-1,Bummed out.. this is super cheaply made and very expensive... the design is different   the color is beautiful  but the material is a different story.. it should be priced at the most 30 bucks.. not 128.. i'm returning them. also  they run very big..!,Pants

0,I was thrilled to find a wide-legged pant in a natural fiber and ordered two pairs - l and xl. the l came first and was a tad too close for comfort so i returned it. when the xl arrived it seemed roomy but after my first wear the fold-over jersey knit waistband stretched out and the pants were dragging on the ground. they seem really huge on me and i now have to wear a belt to keep them up. the fabric also seems to be pilling easily- overall not my best retailer purchase (and i am a huge fan,Pants

0,Maybe if i sized down to a small i'd like them better.. they look ok from the front. but it seems like the leg was cut way too wide. there is exceess material in the back and leg hole. they are not all flattering to my rear end. overall kind of shapeless and the fabric is prone too wrinkling. too expensive (with the added shipping fee for an online exclusive) for the lack of structure and simplicity.,Pants

1,These pants are so comfortable and i love the color  but they did not work for me.,Pants
1,These pants are so cute and flattering. the linen is substantial and the quality of the tailoring is very good. i typically wear a 26p  but they were sold out in the gray color  so i tried the 25p and they fit perfectly. this tells me that they run just a little big  at least in the petite sizing. i wish the rose color was available in petite. i am considering ordering the chocolate as well.,Pants
1,I am 5'5. 125 pounds  size 4-ish (sometimes a 4  sometimes a 6)  athletic build. these pants fit great except they are pretty large around the waist  about 2 extra inches of space. i don't think the problem would be fixed by sizing down since only the waist was large. i will need to get them tailored.,Pants

1,I bought these pants for a planned trip to southeast asia  where i want to look put together but also be very comfortable. the lightweight fabric is perfect for traveling in warm climates where one shouldn't necessarily be wearing shorts in certain public places or when visiting religious sites. these pants can also go to the pool  out on errands and to brunch. i bought the navy and would considering also buying the beige. great find and very reasonable sale price!,Pants

-1,Looked really cute on the hanger  so i took it with me into the dressing room. the fabric is super soft  and the top is very flattering however the bottom is way too short! you can't tell from the picture but the sides are rounded and go up higher on your leg. the model has the waist band pulled lower than i think you'd most likely be wearing it making the outfit appear longer. i wish i could pull this off...maybe i'm just too old for it.,Shorts

-1,These are my all time comfiest shorts and i am obsessed with the lavender color. sadly  using free and clear detergent on a cold  delicate cycle made the color turn splotchy  and they are unwearable. this happened once and i exchanged for another pair  but i'll be returning this pair. i'll be sad to see my favorite color go  but there is obviously a defect in the dye used. maybe i'll try another color!,Shorts

-1,I was disappointed when i got this romper in the mail. the picture looks much cuter than in person. although it's true to size  it looks pretty baggy on. also  i thought the grey (top) and blue (bottom) were too similarly colored; more contrast would have been nice. i'm returning this item.,Shorts

0,I too  was dubious about the dry clean only label but purchased it anyway because it was really cute and comfortable.  the shorts part is lined which is nice.  not see through.  the waist is a smocking with elastic.  it's also very thin thread.  the first one i tried on had a couple of stitches ripped in this waistband and because of that the fabric sort of bubbled out.  i bought a different one knowing it was delicate.  this isn't a romper your going to want to shimmy over your hips because of,Shorts
0,Wore this romper 1x and after washing  the hem on one of the shorts/legs completely unraveled. if i want to ever wear it again  i will have to bring it to a tailor to get fixed. unacceptable for a $200 product. cute design and good fit but questionable quality.,Shorts
0,I'm keeping these shorts because they are cute. i sized down as the previous reviews suggested and they fit great  but they are snug around the legs. i think i would have preferred a more baggy look  but then they would have been too big around the waist (had i ordered my typical size). they are soft and comfortable  the navy color is really pretty.,Shorts

1,I really like these shorts. i'm quite petite and have a hard time finding shorts to fit other than high end denim brands. these are great b/c of the sizing  i wear a 24 in most denim and the 24 in these fit perfectly. also love the length  not too short or long! going to order a second color  i have the plum and love it.,Shorts

-1,What an adorable and frustrating skirt! i'm not a large person: 32d-26-36. and i ordered my normal size small. this is a pull on skirt  and the waist opening could not accommodate either my shoulders or my hips. in most retailer clothes  i'm either a size 2 or 4; i have to agree with the other reviewer. there is no way to put this item on.,Skirts
-1,I'm so upset that this didn't work out. i'm petite at 5'2 and ordered this skirt in petite  however  i felt like it swallowed me up. the fabric is thick and warm so this is definitely only cold weather attire. i'm the picture it looks like there is a little leg showing  but on me  i feel like a schoolmarm. sadly  this is going back.,Skirts
